# Easy Graph

## What it this?

EasyGraph is a little library to interact with GraphQL APIs in a slightly structured way. Probably is a library that is solving
a non-existent problem for anyone apart of me. The motivations behind was basically two:
    - Make my life a bit easier in a project I'm working currently in my job
    - Improve my knowledge in Golang   

## What is the status?

 Easy Graph it's still in a very early stage of development. If you want to contribute, you are welcome!

 ## How it works?

 ## How I run the tests?
